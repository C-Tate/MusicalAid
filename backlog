put scientific nots C4, etc in the legend
put the orientation in landscape, and max it zoomable or even outside the screen

understand why the amplitude is too high
use dot plots again and not lines

"In general, to return a FFT amplitude equal to the amplitude signal which you input to the FFT, you need to normalize FFTs by the number of sample points you're inputting to the FFT."
